                Over 400 cyber crime cases have been registered in the state since the lockdown was imposed. 
                The police on Wednesday asked cyber users to refrain from posting "offensive" messages.
                Anyone violating laws will face strict penal action, said state cyber superintendent of police Balsing Rajput.
                We will be issuing notices individually in the inboxes of users who post offensive messages," he said.

                Such messages, purportedly from the law enforcers for effect, have been flooding social media platforms over the past few days and causing panic.

                A probe into illegal booking of railway tickets using fake IDs on IRCTC's website revealed that the main suspect had hacked into various Union government websites and banks to steal data.
                Railway Protection Force (RPF) officials have filed a complaint with the jurisdictional Rajagopal Nagar police against the suspect as they don't have powers to investigate cases under IPC and Information Technology Act.

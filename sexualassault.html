                A 23-year-old girl, a rape victim, was set ablaze when she was on her way to court to attend a hearing. 
                She had trudged nearly a kilometre striving for help after being set on fire and had called the police herself before collapsing. 
                She died a few days later in Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital. Her alleged rapist stands accused of dousing her with kerosene and setting her on fire. 
                Sadly, she was the second victim within a fortnight of growing sexual violence in India.

                A 19-year-old Dalit woman who had gone missing on December 31, was found hanging from a tree in Modasa, Gujarat on Sunday, January 5.
                The victim’s family has accused four men of gang-rape and murder.           
                After the incident, thousands of Dalits, in protest against the crime, gathered at the Modasa Rural police station demanding arrests of the culprits and removal of the police officer on duty.

                A 5-year-old girl was raped by a neighbor on the grounds of the United States Embassy in India’s capital, the police said on Thursday, reviving a debate about sexual violence against women and children in the country.
                The 25-year-old son of a housekeeper at the embassy was detained in connection with the assault, which took place on Saturday in living quarters reserved for support staff, according to Pragya Anand, the assistant commissioner of police in Chanakyapuri, the capital’s diplomatic area.

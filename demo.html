        <br>
        <p>A Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is a branch of the State Police Services of India responsible for the investigation of crime, based on the Criminal Investigation Departments of British police forces
            The first CID was created by the British Government in 1902, based on the recommendations of the Police Commission. 
            At the entrance of the CID office at Gokhale Marg, Lucknow, there is a portrait of Rai Bahadur Pandit Shambhu Nath, King's Police Medalist (KPM) and Member of British Empire (MBE) with a caption "Father of Indian CID". In 1929, the CID was split into Special Branch, CID and the Crime Branch (CB-CID).
            CB-CID is a special wing in a CID headed by the Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) and assisted by the Inspector General of Police (IGP). This branch investigates serious crimes including murder, riot, forgery, counterfeiting and cases entrusted to CB-CID by the state government or the High Court.
            CID officer is one of a popular career choice among many aspirants who wish to make their career in the field of criminal justice. Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is a crime detection agency that comes under the Government of India. A CID officer investigates the specific cases that are entrusted by the government. 
            To choose a career as a CID officer, one must be a problem solver with strong interpersonal skills and have well-developed reasoning and critical-thinking skills to solve matters pertaining to crime, investigation, prosecution and collection of criminal intelligence.
            The job of CID officers includes investigation of major and complicated crimes like rape, murder, serious assault, communal riots, and frauds. 
            They perform investigative duties such as gathering facts and collecting evidence for criminal cases and fraud, keeping detailed reports of the investigative process, attending autopsies, exchanging information and coordinating activities with other agencies and ensure that the investigation process is completed in a comprehensive and thorough manner, leaving no stone unturned
            The job of investigative officers is to conduct inquiries to discover who committed crimes and to gather evidence to prosecute and convict suspects. They write reports based on the findings and are often called upon to appear in court to explain the results of their investigations.
